# Space Tourism 

The website is called Space Tourism Jet One.
It is a website about a fictional space tourism company.
The website was created by me for practice.
The website is designed to look like a real space tourism company website.
The website includes information about the company and how we will travel the space along with the information about the technology and crew;


## Features

- The website is designed to look like a real space tourism company website. This means that it uses high-quality images and videos, and it has a professional layout. The website also includes a lot of information about the company's history, its fleet of jets, and its plans for future flights. This information is presented in a clear and concise way, and it is easy to understand.
- The website is made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the three main languages that are used to create websites. HTML is used to structure the website, CSS is used to style the website, and JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the website.
The website uses a variety of libraries and frameworks. These are pre-written code that can be used to make development easier. For example, React is a library that is used to create interactive user interfaces, and Redux is a framework that is used to manage state in React applications.
- The website is hosted on Vercel's platform. Vercel is a cloud hosting platform that is specifically designed for websites that are built with React. This means that the website is able to take advantage of Vercel's features, such as automatic deployments andCDN delivery.
- The website is optimized for mobile devices. This means that the website looks good and works well on smartphones and tablets. This is important because more and more people are using their mobile devices to access the internet.
